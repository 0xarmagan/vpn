VPN Compass is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to disrupt the traditional, affiliate-heavy VPN review market. Instead of subjective blog posts, Compass offers a tactical decision matrix analyzing 26 top providers across 15 critical security parameters.

It combines the depth of a technical audit with the interactivity of a modern React application, allowing users to visualize speed data, compare encryption standards, and filter by jurisdiction in real-time.
